# CHR_WebAPI
This is a basic web API for accessing country codes relevant to various supply chain routes throughout North America.

This project was developed using Python and incorporating flask, a lightweight web framework built on top of the Python language.

To access relevant countries for a particular supply chain route in North America, please add '/' to the end of the url and then the three-letter country code, such as PAN for Panama.
